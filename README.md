# LeetCode Practice

This is where I save and share my [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) practice works. 
First step of being a coder.

The practice is listed based on different topics. 
The order of appearances is from easy to medium
(I'll try to get rid of hard problems in the end). 
It's also listed chronologically.

Python is used for each answer. Final solution is taken from [九章算法](http://www.jiuzhang.com/solution/), 
the code of which is laconic and inspiring. Highly recommended:)

My harvests for each practice are summarized [here](/summary.md).
