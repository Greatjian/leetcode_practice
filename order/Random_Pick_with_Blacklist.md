# 864. Random Pick with Blacklist

Given a blacklist B containing unique integers from [0, N), write a function to return a uniform random integer from [0, N) which is NOT in B.

Optimize it such that it minimizes the call to systemâ€™s Math.random().

Note:

- 1 <= N <= 1000000000
- 0 <= B.length < min(100000, N)
- [0, N) does NOT include N. See interval notation.

Example 1:

    Input: 
    ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
    [[1,[]],[],[],[]]
    Output: [null,0,0,0]

Example 2:

    Input: 
    ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
    [[2,[]],[],[],[]]
    Output: [null,1,1,1]

Example 3:

    Input: 
    ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
    [[3,[1]],[],[],[]]
    Output: [null,0,0,2]

Example 4:

    Input: 
    ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
    [[4,[2]],[],[],[]]
    Output: [null,1,3,1]

Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. 
Solution's constructor has two arguments, N and the blacklist B. 
pick has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, 
even if there aren't any.

## Method:

initialize O(n), pick O(1), construct a dict for member in the blacklist:

    class Solution(object):
    
        def __init__(self, N, blacklist):
            """
            :type N: int
            :type blacklist: List[int]
            """
            self.l=N-len(blacklist)
            self.d={}
            start=self.l
            for b in blacklist:
                self.d[b]=-1
            for b in blacklist:
                if b<self.l:
                    while start in self.d:
                        start+=1
                    self.d[b]=start
                    start+=1
    
        def pick(self):
            """
            :rtype: int
            """
            r=random.randint(0, self.l-1)
            if r in self.d:
                return self.d[r]
            return r
    
    
    # Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
    # obj = Solution(N, blacklist)
    # param_1 = obj.pick()
